  System Interrupts Generated Driver File 

  @Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name:
    interrupt_manager.h

  @Summary:
    This is the generated driver implementation file for setting up the
    interrupts using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs interrupts.
    Generation Information : 
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.125
        Device            :  dsPIC33CH128MP508
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.36B
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.20
